This is a game where the user must guess the correct number.
The random module is imported to allow for random number generation.
The correct number is randomly generated from a range of numbers and stored.
Through a while loop, we collect user input and turn it into an integer.
We use an if statement to check if the user's number meets certain criteria.
We utilize try/except to check if user input is not an integer.
If the user has entered valid input and guessed correctly, the loop breaks and the user wins.
