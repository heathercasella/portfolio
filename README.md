This is a game where the user must guess the correct number.<br>
The random module is imported to allow for random number generation.<br>
The correct number is randomly generated from a range of numbers and stored.<br>
Through a while loop, we collect user input and turn it into an integer.<br>
We use an if statement to check if the user's number meets certain criteria.<br>
We utilize try/except to check if user input is not an integer.<br>
If the user has entered valid input and guessed correctly, the loop breaks and the user wins.
